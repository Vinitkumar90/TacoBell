/* 
addItem: (state, action) => {
    state.items.push(action.payload);
}
The action is the object automatically passed to the reducer when you dispatch something.
It usually looks like this:

{
  type: "cart/addItem",       // tells which reducer to run
  payload: "apple"            // data you're sending to the reducer
}
*/


/*
üîÅ Example Flow:
If you dispatch:

dispatch(addItem("apple"));
Redux Toolkit automatically creates this action for you:

{
  type: "cart/addItem",
  payload: "apple"
}
So in your reducer:
action.type = "cart/addItem" ‚Üí helps RTK know which reducer to call.
action.payload = "apple" ‚Üí the actual data you're sending.
